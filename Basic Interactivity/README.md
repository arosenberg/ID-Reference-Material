=========

This project is intended to show students how to quickly add basic interactions to wireframes or styled compositions. 

Requirements
----

This project consists of two folders - Mobile and Web. Each folder contains the appropriate artwork to complete the sample. We'll be using [Marvel App] to create more engaging wireframes that would be appropriate for client-deliverables.
